# An experiment, no longer being developed. 

A little library to build arbitrarily complex forms in React, with  Zustand for state management.

After experimenting with this approach in a large project that contained a lot of very unusual/demanding forms, I'm working on something better (hopefully better, and as typesafe as possible)... stay tuned.
